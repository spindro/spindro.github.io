      <description>Luigi Feda and I recently released on social media a teaser of PLVS in action. Here you can find more info and a lot of videos of PLVS showing its capabilities on many different datasets. PLVS is still a work in progress but the software will be released as open-source with our outcoming paper very soon!</description>

      <description>This is the first post of my personal page and in some sense, the story behind this blog.
I had the privilege to collaborate as a bachelor and later master student to a European project TRADR: Long-Term Human-Robot Teaming for Disaster Response. Something very unusual here in Italy, in fact, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been always easy to make this intern at the Alcor lab, which was responsible for the WP4 of the project, coexist with my ordinary studies.</description>
