      <title>TRADR experience</title>

      <description>This is the first post of my personal page and in some sense, the story the beginning of my interest in research. I had the privilege to collaborate as a bachelor and later master student to an European project TRADR: Long-Term Human-Robot Teaming for Disaster Response. It has not been always easy to make this intern at the Alcor lab coexist with my ordinary studies, but was worth it. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of stuff, travelled as much and made new connections.</description>
